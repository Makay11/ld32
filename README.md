# Sound Runner
Game developed in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 32 Jam.

# Instructions
To play the game you can visit the [website](http://ld32.diogopais.com) or clone the repository, enter the directory, write `npm i --production` in the terminal, followed by `npm start` and you can then play at [http://localhost:6900](http://localhost:6900).

To develop you can use the development mode by writing `npm i` instead, followed by `npm run dev`. In this mode everything will autocompile but it will not work on Windows.
